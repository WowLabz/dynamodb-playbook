# Concepts & Structure

- Access-pattern-first modeling; item collections.
- Partitions & adaptive capacity; hot keys and sharding.
- Consistency trade-offs: base table/LSI (strong) vs GSI (eventual).
- Write sharding, scatter/gather reads, counters & idempotency.
- Streams → Lambda pipelines; DLQ; backpressure.
- Cost levers: projections, item shape, on-demand vs provisioned.
- Ops: metrics, alarms, PITR/DR, migrations/backfills.
